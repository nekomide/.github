# Vulnerability reporting
Please report security vulnerabilities to [security@raynec.dev](mailto:security@raynec.dev). Do not use GitHub's issue feature.

Security is a important aspect for me in the development of Nekomide, and I really appreciate you taking the time to report a security vulnerability responsibly.

I will try to respond to your email within 48 hours. If I don't respond within this time, post a GitHub issue asking me to view your report, but do not post any details.

After I've received a vulnerability report, I will take measures to patch it as soon as possible. Once a patch is published, a popup will appear on affected versions asking to update.
